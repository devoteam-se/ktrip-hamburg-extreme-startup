# JavaScript boilerplate for Extreme Startup

* All code is in index.js
* To start, run `npm start` or just `node index.js`
* (Documentation for routing is available)[https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html]

## Requirements

* Node (most version should work I think)
* npm/yarn to install `express`
